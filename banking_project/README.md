## Challenges & Key Takeaways 🚧

The road to **Titan Bank** was not smooth, but that's what made the adventure so thrilling! 😅

- **Transfers Between Accounts**: The real rollercoaster ride! At first, there was a bit of chaos with transferring money between accounts, and this part took the longest to get right. But after some tweaking, it was all smooth sailing! 🚢
  
- **Synchronizing CSV Database**: Keeping everything in sync with the **CSV database** was another beast to tackle. Every time an operation like a deposit, withdrawal, or transfer was made, I needed to update the database correctly. It was all about making sure the data was saved and updated after every action. 🗂️

Through all this, I learned **patience** and how important it is to track and connect the pieces of code. I had to ensure that everything was properly **aligned** – from indentation to function calls – so that the code didn’t misbehave. 😤

At the end of the day, **I became a master of debugging**! 🎯 Even the most stubborn errors couldn’t stand in my way. This journey taught me how to **persist**, problem-solve, and become a more organized developer.

**In summary**: It wasn’t always easy, but with patience and persistence, I turned challenges into stepping stones. Titan Bank might have started as a simple project, but it evolved into a real adventure! 🚀
